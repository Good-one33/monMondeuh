      I know I didn't write last two days, but if I didn't write here it
      means that I wrote somewhere else, yes of cours I do have an agenda.
      we all have some stuff that we don't really want to share with anyone
      else especially when we don't know who is the reader
      <br />
      anyway, work still in progress it's early to claim victory I just
      started but I can feel a change, after drooping all booring apps from
      my phone I have lot of time and I can do more things I feel quiet and
      I look calm in my daily life, like for example when I am in the bus or
      the RER I can sit down while keeping my posture stright I don't bow
      tho his majesty The Mobile Phone. <br />

        >é gros, tu exagères la ! tu t'es séparé de tes putaines d'applis
        quelques jours et tu commences dèja à te la raconter, ça va pas la
        tête ou quoi ! tu penses vraiment que je vais te laisser me priver
        de tous les plaisirs que le digital nous a offert? je te dis une
        chose tu rêves ! ce corps n'est pas à toi seul alors arrête de faire
        le English man la!

      time and we will find an alternative to all these distractions,

      your body again and work on your handstand I know you like that so
