          I am listening to this song, it is so cool, next time I will try to
          play it in background when you came check one of my black boxes,so you
          can enjoy the song :) I have a lot of things and features that I want
          to add to my space. For now I am just trying to keep writing regulary,
          it makes me feel better and progressing with my english, I will try as
          possible as I can to not stop even one time, when you keep doing
          something it will become a habit and this one is a good habit <br />
          it's not easy to find a subject to talk about, especially when you are
          alone,but I am lucky, my dear friend is always here next to me when I
          want to discuss and express myself, no he isn't a real person, I just
          created him like that, in my mind <br />
          <i>
            attends, attends, c'est de moi que tu parles là ? c'est qui le vrai
            entre nous deux ? normalement cette questions ne se pose même pas !
          </i>

          hey dude, do you know the expression "le mec n'est pas seul dans sa

          to sleep it's midnight
