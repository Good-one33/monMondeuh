I finaly did it, I always used to write but this time I made it
public, I just wanted to improve my english I decided three days ago
to work on my self, I often make such decisions but this time I am
taking it seriously, from today and so on I will always write where
ever I am, even if I don't really know what to talk about but I do
believe that my minde will neveer let me out of ideas it will bring me
happyness, all what he is asking for is <b>Thrust</b>

  I know I didn't write last two days, but if I didn't write here it
  means that I wrote somewhere else, yes of cours I do have an agenda.
  we all have some stuff that we don't really want to share with anyone
  else especially when we don't know who is the reader
  <br />
  anyway, work still in progress it's early to claim victory I just
  started but I can feel a change, after drooping all booring apps from
  my phone I have lot of time and I can do more things I feel quiet and
  I look calm in my daily life, like for example when I am in the bus or
  the RER I can sit down while keeping my posture stright I don't bow
  tho his majesty The Mobile Phone. <br />

  <i>é gros, tu exagères la ! tu t'es séparé de tes putaines d'applis
    quelques jours et tu commences dèja à te la raconter, ça va pas la
    tête ou quoi ! tu penses vraiment que je vais te laisser me priver
    de tous les plaisirs que le digital nous a offert? je te dis une
    chose tu rêves ! ce corps n'est pas à toi seul alors arrête de faire
    le English man la!
  </i>
  <br />
  I know it's booring and hard to change habits, it will take a bit of
  time and we will find an alternative to all these distractions,
  believe me this will take our life to the next level and by the way do
  you know that the gym will open wensday ? in two days you can shape
  your body again and work on your handstand I know you like that so
  just keep calme and go to sleep now! tomorow will be a great day :)

Today is a great day,it's my birthday, in a tuesday like this one, at
3 am in the morning I opened my eyes for the first time and I said
<i>" Hello world it's me, Abdelmalek :) "</i>. <br />
This afternoon I was laying in the bad and I started thinking and
imagining the world without me, like what if I didn't existe what will
change ? and to be honest I didn't find a significant contribution,
till now my life is like a 7 billion people's life in this world.
<br />
I always dreamed big, I had a bunch of amazing things that I wanted to
do but something was stopping me, I was afraid ! the fear of not
getting things done, fear of being rejected, but this was the past,
now I am seeing things differently I will go all the way to be the
person I always wanted to be,<br />
<i> wish me a good luck and a happy birthday :)</i>

  I am listening to this song, it is so cool, next time I will try to
  play it in background when you came check one of my black boxes,so you
  can enjoy the song :) I have a lot of things and features that I want
  to add to my space. For now I am just trying to keep writing regulary,
  it makes me feel better and progressing with my english, I will try as
  possible as I can to not stop even one time, when you keep doing
  something it will become a habit and this one is a good habit <br />
  it's not easy to find a subject to talk about, especially when you are
  alone,but I am lucky, my dear friend is always here next to me when I
  want to discuss and express myself, no he isn't a real person, I just
  created him like that, in my mind <br />
  <i>
    attends, attends, c'est de moi que tu parles là ? c'est qui le vrai
    entre nous deux ? normalement cette questions ne se pose même pas !
  </i>
  <br />
  hey dude, do you know the expression "le mec n'est pas seul dans sa
  tête ?" maybe we are more than two here ! so keep calme and let's go
  to sleep it's midnight

    <div class="personZero">Here is a story of a young guy who just came back home from work , he likes his job, a little bit far but 
      he is used to it, he had a bath, cold as usual and took a quick dinner. He is living alone, none to talk to, so he took his phone
       and started scrolling  and switching between different apps, he found himself watching everything and anything in the same time ,  
        as a result he got easily bored, he threw  the phone away and lay on his bed, he is not good at talking to people  on networks 
        so, he closed his eyes and  he started talking to himself, he was tired so he fell asleep in a short time.
      He found himself walking in a street in an old city , it was night and there is no a lot of light, he started looking around  and 
      he was sure that he came here before, no one in the street it seems like a desrted city or this is just because the weather was frozen, 
      he is arrived in front  a specific building  which was familiar to him, he got a flash back and went straight forward to open the door </div>
    <div class="personOne"> Hello, welcome back, it has been a while, but I was sure that you will end up knocking on my door,
       come in, have a seat  and let's have a real conversation this time.   </div>
    <div class="personTwo"> nothing changed here, you're still keeping these old furniture, I hope it's not the same for your ideas
    </div>
    <div class="personOne">No, don't worry, even I am not using the internet a lot like you, everything is up to date in my mind,
       old school guy, you know but now tell me, what brought you here, did something happen ?</div>

       <div class="personTwo">Well, hard to explain,Do you know that moment when you feel like you 
         are missing something but you don't really know  what on earth it is ?
         I tried a lot of things to fix that, but without success, sometimes you realize just from the beginning that, what are 
         you planning to do  will not change anything but worse than that is when you start seeing results and being happier and
          more confident, but if only one time, just one time you let your guard down, failure will smash your face and push you
           down to sadness  <br> I was  looping on these ups and downs, but this time I am really wondering if me as a human, 
           should live like this?  Is it my destiny or it's up to me to make my life a stable  straight line? You are coming from 
           another dimension, so maybe you have some answers, I want to know if in this world someone lived his life as I am trying
           to live it or in fact what I am looking for will never gonna happen and I am just starting a new loop in another wrong way? </div>
