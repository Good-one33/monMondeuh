    <div class="personZero">Here is a story of a young guy who just came back home from work , he likes his job, a little bit far but 
      he is used to it, he had a bath, cold as usual and took a quick dinner. He is living alone, none to talk to, so he took his phone
       and started scrolling  and switching between different apps, he found himself watching everything and anything in the same time ,  
        as a result he got easily bored, he threw  the phone away and lay on his bed, he is not good at talking to people  on networks 
        so, he closed his eyes and  he started talking to himself, he was tired so he fell asleep in a short time.
      He found himself walking in a street in an old city , it was night and there is no a lot of light, he started looking around  and 
      he was sure that he came here before, no one in the street it seems like a desrted city or this is just because the weather was frozen, 
      he is arrived in front  a specific building  which was familiar to him, he got a flash back and went straight forward to open the door </div>
    <div class="personOne"> Hello, welcome back, it has been a while, but I was sure that you will end up knocking on my door,
       come in, have a seat  and let's have a real conversation this time.   </div>
    <div class="personTwo"> nothing changed here, you're still keeping these old furniture, I hope it's not the same for your ideas
    </div>
    <div class="personOne">No, don't worry, even I am not using the internet a lot like you, everything is up to date in my mind,
       old school guy, you know but now tell me, what brought you here, did something happen ?</div>

       <div class="personTwo">Well, hard to explain,Do you know that moment when you feel like you 
         are missing something but you don't really know  what on earth it is ?
         I tried a lot of things to fix that, but without success, sometimes you realize just from the beginning that, what are 
         you planning to do  will not change anything but worse than that is when you start seeing results and being happier and
          more confident, but if only one time, just one time you let your guard down, failure will smash your face and push you
           down to sadness  <br> I was  looping on these ups and downs, but this time I am really wondering if me as a human, 
           should live like this?  Is it my destiny or it's up to me to make my life a stable  straight line? You are coming from 
           another dimension, so maybe you have some answers, I want to know if in this world someone lived his life as I am trying
           to live it or in fact what I am looking for will never gonna happen and I am just starting a new loop in another wrong way? </div>
